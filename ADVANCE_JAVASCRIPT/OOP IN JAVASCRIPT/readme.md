# OOP(Object-Oriented_Programming) in Javascript 

## Javascript is a Prototype based language, Where almost all are Object

# Four Pillar of OOP :

## Encapsulation : Bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class), and restricting access to some of the object's components.

## Abstraction : Hiding complex details and showing only the essential features of the object. or Using a remote control without needing to understand how it works inside.

## Polymorphism(different forms) :  Allowing methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon ,  A single word having different meanings in different contexts.

## Inheritence :  Creating a new class based on an existing class, inheriting its properties and methods, A child inheriting traits from their parents.
